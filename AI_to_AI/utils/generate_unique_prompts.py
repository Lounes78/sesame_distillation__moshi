NEW PROMPT: "{new_prompt}"

EXISTING SIMILAR PROMPTS:

TASK: Determine if the NEW PROMPT is too similar to any of the existing prompts.

Consider these as TOO SIMILAR:
- Same core question with different wording
- Same topic with nearly identical intent
- Asking the same thing in different ways
- Would generate very similar responses

Consider these as DIFFERENT ENOUGH:
- Different aspects of the same broad topic
- Different question types (how vs what vs when)
- Different scope or specificity
- Would generate notably different responses

Respond with ONLY:
"DUPLICATE" - if too similar to existing prompts
"UNIQUE" - if sufficiently different
